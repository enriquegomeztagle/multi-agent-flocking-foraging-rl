# Medium Mode V5 (HARDER) - Targeting 60-70% Efficiency
#
# This configuration is HARDER than V4, designed to achieve the 60-70% efficiency
# target if V4 exceeds it (expected 70-80%).
#
# PROGRESSION:
# Easy Mode:   5 agents, 20 patches, 20×20 world → 87.22% efficiency ✅
# Medium V4:   10 agents, 18 patches, 23×23 world → Expected: 70-80%
# Medium V5:   10 agents, 15 patches, 28×28 world → Target: 60-70% ✅
# Hard Mode:   15 agents, 8 patches, 60×60 world → 4.89% efficiency (too hard)
#
# KEY CHANGES FROM V4:
# - Patches: 18 → 15 (-17% resources, more scarcity)
# - World: 23×23 → 28×28 (+48% area, more exploration needed)
# - Feed radius: 3.8 → 3.5 (-8% feed area)
# - Consumption: 0.077 → 0.070 (-9% intake rate)
# - Capacity: 2.8 → 2.5 (-11% patch capacity)
# - Regeneration: 0.37 → 0.32 (-14% regen rate)
#
# This creates a difficulty level between V4 and original hard mode.

# DIFFICULTY ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================
#
# Agent-to-Patch Ratio:
# - Easy:   5/20  = 0.25 agents per patch
# - V4:     10/18 = 0.56 agents per patch
# - V5:     10/15 = 0.67 agents per patch ⬅ MORE COMPETITION
# - Hard:   15/8  = 1.875 agents per patch
#
# Patch Density (patches per unit²):
# - Easy:   20/400 = 0.050 patches/unit²
# - V4:     18/529 = 0.034 patches/unit²
# - V5:     15/784 = 0.019 patches/unit² ⬅ SPARSER
# - Hard:   8/3,600 = 0.002 patches/unit²
#
# World Area:
# - Easy:   400 unit²
# - V4:     529 unit² (1.32x larger than easy)
# - V5:     784 unit² (1.96x larger than easy) ⬅ MORE EXPLORATION
# - Hard:   3,600 unit² (9x larger than easy)
#
# Feed Zone Area:
# - Easy:   π × 4.0² = 50.3 unit²
# - V4:     π × 3.8² = 45.4 unit²
# - V5:     π × 3.5² = 38.5 unit² ⬅ SMALLER FEED ZONE
# - Hard:   π × 2.5² = 19.6 unit²
#
# Theoretical Maximum Intake:
# - Easy:   5 × 2000 × 0.08 = 800 (achieved 87%)
# - V4:     10 × 2500 × 0.077 = 1,925 total
# - V5:     10 × 2500 × 0.070 = 1,750 total ⬅ LOWER MAX
# - Hard:   15 × 3000 × 0.05 = 2,250 total
#
# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (WITH FLOCKING REWARDS):
# Parameters ~85-90% as good as V4:
# - 50-60% efficiency: 875-1,050 intake (below target)
# - 60-70% efficiency: 1,050-1,225 intake (TARGET) ✅
# - 70-80% efficiency: 1,225-1,400 intake (exceeds target)
#
# RATIONALE:
# If V4 achieves 70-80% (as expected), this V5 configuration should achieve
# the target 60-70% efficiency by:
# - 17% fewer patches (more competition for resources)
# - 48% larger world (harder navigation and coordination)
# - 8-14% worse resource parameters (slower intake and regeneration)
# - Still has flocking rewards active (both behaviors necessary)
