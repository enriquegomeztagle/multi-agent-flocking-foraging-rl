# Medium Mode Configuration for Multi-Agent Flocking and Foraging
#
# This is a GRADUAL difficulty increase from easy mode, providing an intermediate
# training challenge before attempting hard mode.
#
# PROGRESSION:
# Easy Mode:   5 agents, 20 patches, 20×20 world → 87.22% efficiency ✅ (with flocking)
# Medium Mode: 10 agents, 18 patches, 23×23 world → Target: 60-70% efficiency
# Hard Mode:   15 agents, 8 patches, 60×60 world → 4.89% efficiency (too hard!) ⚠️
#
# KEY INCREMENTAL CHANGES FROM EASY MODE:
# - Agents: 5 → 10 (2x increase, manageable)
# - Patches: 20 → 18 (10% reduction, minimal scarcity)
# - World: 20×20 → 23×23 (1.32x area, minimal exploration challenge)
# - Competition: 0.25 → 0.56 agents/patch (2.2x, still <1)
#
# UPDATED V4: VERY close to easy mode params + flocking rewards active

# DIFFICULTY ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================
#
# Agent-to-Patch Ratio:
# - Easy:   5/20  = 0.25 agents per patch (low competition)
# - Medium: 10/18 = 0.56 agents per patch (moderate competition) ⬅ VERY CLOSE TO EASY
# - Hard:   15/8  = 1.875 agents per patch (high competition)
#
# Patch Density (patches per unit²):
# - Easy:   20/400 = 0.050 patches/unit²
# - Medium: 18/529 = 0.034 patches/unit² (1.47x less dense) ⬅ VERY CLOSE TO EASY
# - Hard:   8/3,600 = 0.002 patches/unit² (22x less dense)
#
# World Area:
# - Easy:   400 unit²
# - Medium: 529 unit² (1.32x larger) ⬅ VERY CLOSE TO EASY
# - Hard:   3,600 unit² (9x larger)
#
# Feed Zone Area:
# - Easy:   π × 4.0² = 50.3 units²
# - Medium: π × 3.8² = 45.4 units² (1.1x smaller) ⬅ VERY CLOSE TO EASY
# - Hard:   π × 2.5² = 19.6 units² (2.6x smaller)
#
# Theoretical Maximum Intake:
# - Easy:   5 × 2000 × 0.08 = 800 (achieved 87% with flocking!)
# - Medium: 10 × 2500 × 0.077 = 1,925 total ⬅ INCREASED
# - Hard:   15 × 3000 × 0.05 = 2,250 total
#
# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (V4 - WITH FLOCKING REWARDS):
# With parameters VERY close to easy mode + flocking rewards active:
# - 50-60% efficiency: 963-1,155 intake (baseline)
# - 60-70% efficiency: 1,155-1,348 intake (target) ✅
# - 70-80% efficiency: 1,348-1,540 intake (excellent)
# - 80%+ efficiency: 1,540+ intake (exceptional, like easy mode!)
#
# CHANGES FROM V3 (in progress):
# ✅ More patches: 17 → 18 (+6% resources)
# ✅ Smaller world: 25×25 → 23×23 (-15% area, much easier navigation)
# ✅ Larger feed radius: 3.7 → 3.8 (+5% feed area)
# ✅ Higher consumption: 0.075 → 0.077 (+3% intake rate)
# ✅ More capacity: 2.7 → 2.8 (+4% patch capacity)
# ✅ Faster regen: 0.35 → 0.37 (+6% regeneration)
# ✅ Flocking rewards ACTIVE (cohesion, alignment, separation, group bonus)
#
# CUMULATIVE CHANGES FROM V1 (34% actual):
# ✅ More patches: 12 → 18 (+50% resources!)
# ✅ Smaller world: 35×35 → 23×23 (-57% area!)
# ✅ Larger feed radius: 3.0 → 3.8 (+27% feed area)
# ✅ Higher consumption: 0.065 → 0.077 (+18% intake rate)
# ✅ More capacity: 2.0 → 2.8 (+40% patch capacity)
# ✅ Faster regen: 0.25 → 0.37 (+48% regeneration)
