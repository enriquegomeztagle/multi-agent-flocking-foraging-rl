# Medium Mode Configuration for Multi-Agent Flocking and Foraging
#
# This is a GRADUAL difficulty increase from easy mode, providing an intermediate
# training challenge before attempting hard mode.
#
# PROGRESSION:
# Easy Mode:   5 agents, 20 patches, 20×20 world → 85.45% efficiency ✅
# Medium Mode: 10 agents, 15 patches, 28×28 world → Target: 60-70% efficiency
# Hard Mode:   15 agents, 8 patches, 60×60 world → 4.89% efficiency (too hard!) ⚠️
#
# KEY INCREMENTAL CHANGES FROM EASY MODE:
# - Agents: 5 → 10 (2x increase, manageable)
# - Patches: 20 → 15 (25% reduction, moderate scarcity)
# - World: 20×20 → 28×28 (1.96x area, moderate exploration)
# - Competition: 0.25 → 0.67 agents/patch (2.7x, still <1)
#
# UPDATED: Made significantly easier based on evaluation results (was 34% efficiency)

# DIFFICULTY ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================
#
# Agent-to-Patch Ratio:
# - Easy:   5/20  = 0.25 agents per patch (low competition)
# - Medium: 10/15 = 0.67 agents per patch (moderate competition) ⬅ IMPROVED
# - Hard:   15/8  = 1.875 agents per patch (high competition)
#
# Patch Density (patches per unit²):
# - Easy:   20/400 = 0.050 patches/unit²
# - Medium: 15/784 = 0.019 patches/unit² (2.6x less dense) ⬅ IMPROVED
# - Hard:   8/3,600 = 0.002 patches/unit² (22x less dense)
#
# World Area:
# - Easy:   400 unit²
# - Medium: 784 unit² (1.96x larger) ⬅ IMPROVED
# - Hard:   3,600 unit² (9x larger)
#
# Feed Zone Area:
# - Easy:   π × 4.0² = 50.3 units²
# - Medium: π × 3.5² = 38.5 units² (1.3x smaller) ⬅ IMPROVED
# - Hard:   π × 2.5² = 19.6 units² (2.6x smaller)
#
# Theoretical Maximum Intake:
# - Easy:   5 × 2000 × 0.08 = 800 (achieved ~1,925 with regeneration!)
# - Medium: 10 × 2500 × 0.072 = 1,800 total ⬅ INCREASED
# - Hard:   15 × 3000 × 0.05 = 2,250 total
#
# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (REVISED):
# With the easier configuration, medium mode should achieve:
# - 50-60% efficiency: 900-1,080 intake (baseline)
# - 60-70% efficiency: 1,080-1,260 intake (target) ✅
# - 70%+ efficiency: 1,260+ intake (excellent)
#
# CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION (34% actual → 60-70% target):
# ✅ More patches: 12 → 15 (+25% resources)
# ✅ Smaller world: 35×35 → 28×28 (-36% area, easier navigation)
# ✅ Larger feed radius: 3.0 → 3.5 (+36% feed area)
# ✅ Higher consumption: 0.065 → 0.072 (+11% intake rate)
# ✅ More capacity: 2.0 → 2.5 (+25% patch capacity)
# ✅ Faster regen: 0.25 → 0.30 (+20% regeneration)
# ✅ Slightly slower movement (easier control)
