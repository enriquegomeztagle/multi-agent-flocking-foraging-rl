# Very Hard Mode Configuration - Targeting 15-25% Efficiency
#
# This is significantly harder than Hard V5 but more feasible than original hard mode.
#
# PROGRESSION:
# Easy:      5 agents, 20 patches, 20×20 world → 87.22% efficiency ✅
# Medium V4: 10 agents, 18 patches, 23×23 world → 72.55% efficiency ✅
# Hard V5:   10 agents, 15 patches, 28×28 world → 45.90% efficiency ✅
# Very Hard V6: 12 agents, 10 patches, 35×35 world → Target: 15-25% efficiency
#
# KEY CHALLENGES:
# - High agent/patch ratio (1.2 - intense competition)
# - Very sparse patches (0.0082/unit² - hard to find)
# - Large world requiring coordination
# - Reduced resources (lower feed radius, consumption, capacity, regen)
#
# This configuration bridges the gap between V5 (45.90%) and original hard (4.89%)

#
# Agent-to-Patch Ratio:
# - Easy:      5/20  = 0.25 agents per patch
# - Medium:    10/18 = 0.56 agents per patch

# - Very Hard: 12/10 = 1.20 agents per patch ⬅ INTENSE COMPETITION
#
# Patch Density (patches per unit²):
# - Easy:      20/400   = 0.050 patches/unit²

# - Medium:    529 unit²
# - Hard:      784 unit²
# - Very Hard: 1,225 unit² ⬅ 3x larger than easy
#
# Feed Zone Area:
# - Easy:      π × 4.0² = 50.3 unit²
# - Medium:    π × 3.8² = 45.4 unit²

#
# Theoretical Maximum Intake:

# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (WITH FLOCKING REWARDS):
# Based on difficulty progression:
# - 10-15% efficiency: 174-261 intake (below target)
# - 15-25% efficiency: 261-435 intake (TARGET) ✅
# - 25-30% efficiency: 435-522 intake (exceeds target)

# DIFFICULTY FACTORS:
# - 20% more agents than Hard V5 (coordination challenge)
# - 33% fewer patches than Hard V5 (extreme scarcity)
# - 56% larger world than Hard V5 (exploration challenge)
# - 20% smaller feed radius (harder to feed)
# - 17% lower consumption rate (slower intake)
# - 20% lower patch capacity (quick depletion)
# - 25% slower regeneration (resource pressure)
#

# - Excellent flocking coordination
# - Efficient exploration strategies
# - Resource sharing among agents
# - Adaptive foraging behavior
