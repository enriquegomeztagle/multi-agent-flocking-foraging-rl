# Easy Mode Configuration for 70%+ Efficiency Target
#
# This configuration makes the foraging problem significantly easier:
# - Fewer agents (5 instead of 10) = less competition
# - More patches (20 instead of 15) = more resources
# - Smaller world (20x20 instead of 30x30) = less travel time
# - Better resource parameters = easier feeding
#
# Expected theoretical max: ~800 intake (5 agents × 2000 steps × 0.08 c_max)
# Expected realistic performance: 500-600 intake with good policy
# Target: 70%+ of recalculated baseline

# World dimensions
width: 20.0              # Reduced from 30.0 - less travel distance
height: 20.0             # Reduced from 30.0
dt: 0.2                  # Time step (unchanged)

# Agent configuration
n_agents: 5              # Reduced from 10 - easier coordination
k_neighbors: 4           # Keep at 4 for 5 agents

# Agent dynamics
v_max: 1.5               # Max velocity (unchanged)
a_max: 0.2               # Max acceleration (unchanged)
turn_max: 0.3            # Max turn rate (unchanged)

# Foraging parameters
feed_radius: 4.0         # Increased from 3.0 - easier to feed
c_max: 0.08              # Increased from 0.06 - more intake per step

# Flocking
d_safe: 0.6              # Safety distance (unchanged)

# Resource patches
S_max: 3.0               # Increased from 1.0 - larger patch capacity
S_thr: 0.6               # Sustainability threshold (60% of S_max)
regen_r: 0.4             # Increased from 0.3 - faster regeneration
n_patches: 20            # Increased from 15 - more food sources

# Episode settings
episode_len: 2000        # Increased from 1500 - more time to collect

# Notes on difficulty reduction:
# 1. Agent/patch ratio: 5/20 = 0.25 (was 10/15 = 0.67) - much less competition
# 2. World area: 400 (was 900) - 2.25x less area to cover
# 3. Patch density: 20/400 = 0.05 patches/unit² (was 15/900 = 0.017) - 3x denser
# 4. Feed radius area: π×4² = 50.3 (was π×3² = 28.3) - 78% larger feeding zone
# 5. Total available per step: 20 patches × 0.08 c_max = 1.6 (was 15 × 0.06 = 0.9)
# 6. Time budget: 2000 steps (was 1500) - 33% more time
#
# Combined effect: Approximately 8-10x easier problem overall
