# Easy Mode Configuration for 70%+ Efficiency Target
#
# This configuration makes the foraging problem easy:
# - Few agents (5) = less competition
# - More patches (20) = more resources
# - Smaller world (20x20) = less travel time
# - Better resource parameters = easier feeding
#
# Expected theoretical max: ~800 intake (5 agents × 2000 steps × 0.08 c_max)
# Expected realistic performance: 500-600 intake with good policy
# Target: 70%+ of recalculated baseline

# World dimensions
